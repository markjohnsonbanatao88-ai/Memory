# Phase 4A fix worklog

PR #100 was merged into main.

Production redeploy trigger:
- Purpose: force Vercel to retry deployment of the Phase 4A Memory Bridge after the earlier build-rate-limit failure.
- Expected production release: Phase 4A Memory Bridge.
- Previous production SHA before retry: 789d6554be08f6d01fd944a27cc07d2c2cf99830.
- Phase 4A merge SHA: a373cb7717ff3ab95786494cdef85f69cff5d149.

Second deployment retry:
- Purpose: retry after Vercel build-rate-limit blocked the first redeploy trigger.
- Expected latest main SHA after this commit should become the production deployment source once Vercel quota clears.
